        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        " -Python is a programming language that is easy to learn and use. It is popular because it has simple, readable code and can be used for many different tasks, like building websites, analyzing data, and creating artificial intelligence.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -An interpreter in Python is a tool that reads and runs your Python code one line at a time. It makes it easy to test and see results quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " -Pre-defined keywords in Python are special words that have a specific meaning and purpose in the language. You can't use them as names for variables or functions. Ex:if,else,while,for.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        " - No keywords can't be used as variable names because they have special meanings in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " -n Python, mutability means whether an object can change after it's created & Ex:list,dict,set.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        " -Lists are mutable because they are meant to be changed .Tuples are immutable because they are meant to stay the same and protect their data.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "  - True if both conditions are true.\n",
        "  - True if at least one condition is true.\n",
        "  - Reverses the condition.\n",
        "8. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "  - Type casting in Python means changing a value from one type to another.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "  - Implicit: Python does it for you automatically\n",
        "  - Explicit: You do it yourself\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to make decisions in your code based on condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "     \n",
        "11.  How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\n",
        "      - The elif statement helps you check multiple conditions in a program, providing different outcomes based on different scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "  - for loop iterates over sequences with a known number of iterations.\n",
        "  - whileloop repeats as long as a condition is True.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Use a while loop when you don't know how many times you need to loop until a specific condition is fulfilled.\n",
